# ReactTicTacToe

project for The c# Academy that can be found here: https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/35

Did most of the challenges.

React was always interesting to me but the dependency hell always made me not enjoy it as much as Angular.

It's nice to revisit it and i'll probably do some of the other academy projects.
